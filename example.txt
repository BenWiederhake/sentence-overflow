In tree-form(1) this abomination is easy(2) to read.
    (1), by which I(3) mean writing(4) each parenthesis(12) as a separate(13) line,
        (3), the crazy(6) author of this tool,
            (6), because I(9) was so preoccupied with one question(7) that I forgot to ask another(8) question(11),
                (9), as the famous quote(10) goes,
                    (10), from a movie in which the scientists have also created an unspeakable abomination,
                (7), namely whether or not I *could* write this insane sentence generator
                (8), much more important,
                (11), specifically whether or not I *should* build it
        (4), or more correctly(5) "notating"
            (5), although one could argue that there should(20) be no comparative form of this word,
                (20), which in turn raises the fascinating(21) question of normativity versus descriptivity,
                    (21), or at least fascinating to Tom Scott(22) and me,
                        (22), as evidenced in several of his lovely "Language Files" videos,
        (12), ironically with their numbers(14) written in parenthesis,
            (14), which mainly(15) serve as an identification for easy reference
                (15), but not exclusively, as they also represent the order in which this was written,
        (13), indented, and thus already pre-parsed, easily-editable, and verifiable,
    (2), or at least easier than the long(16) form,
        (16), often-critized, especially by Mark Twain(17),
            (17), who appears to lament(18) the German language(19) exceedingly often and publicly
                (18), mostly in the form of notes in his notebook, but also speeches, stories, and books,
                (19), both in general and sometimes specific words like "Generalstaatsverordnetenversammlungen",
